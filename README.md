# Pittsburgh-SideScroller-Gameboy-Game
A sidescrolling game written in C for the Gameboy

This is a simple sidescrolling game I'm working on using the GBDK for gameboy.
Currently it's not much to look at but my hope is to turn it into something more than a tech demo.
The main thing I"m getting stuck on is hexidecimal and the limited amount of memory the gameboy allows for tiles. 

Feel free to add to the source code if you'd like. 
Also the rom will work in emulation.
